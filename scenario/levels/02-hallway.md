<p class="text-lg text-amber-900 mb-4">
You open the mailbox, and behind it is a door.
Behind the door is a hallway.
</p>

<p class="text-lg text-amber-900 mb-4">
It is longer than your home could possibly contain.
Still, the lighting is warm. Still, it welcomes you.
</p>

<p class="text-lg text-amber-900 mb-6">
The paintings show familiar places.
Not one of them shows you.
</p>

<p class="text-lg text-amber-900 mb-6">
You feel a sentence hiding in plain sight.
</p>

Hint: Sometimes the page whispers the same color as the paper.
